					<p>This photo was taken when our eldest was only 2 years old. We went out for a walk and he was very excited to do so even when the weather was a little cold. Also at that time, I had my very first DSLR camera Nikon D3000. Although a beginner's camera, it was sufficient enough to provide me in what I needed. I really love this picture of him, had it printed and have been hanging in our wall ever since. </p>

					<p>This photo was taken I believed a year after from the picture of our eldest. This was taken with a Nikon D7000 and a DIY ND filter. This filter is actually one of those that is used by welders to protect their eyes. This particular filter cast a green color on the photo and must be adjusted post production. I was actually having a hard time adjusting it to get to the actual color and I end up doing black and white.</p>

				<p id="first_p"> My name is Romer Tanaleon and welcome to fivetwOneSix website. The goal of this site is to show my work on landscape photography or any photo that I took that is worth showing to the world. I am not a professional nor an expert on the subject matter but I try to do my best. I don't travel to other countries to take a photo of a beautiful landscape (I wish I could), so the ones I posts are the ones that are easily accessible for me such as the Cloud Gate in downtown Chicago.</p>

				<p>I am also about to dip my feet into astrophotography as I am always fascinated and always thinking on what is out there. Are we or are we not alone? Pretty sure we are not but, that is up to you on what to decide.</p>

				<p>By learning web design through General Assembly, I hope I can create a stunning website and keep you captivated and wanting for more. Take care and enjoy!</p>

			<p id="first_p"> My name is Romer Tanaleon and welcome to fivetwOneSix website. The goal of this site is to show my work on landscape photography. I am not a professional nor an expert on the subject matter but I try to do my best. I don't travel to other countries to take a photo of a beautiful landscape (I wish I could), so the ones I posts are the ones that are easily accessible for me such as the Cloud Gate in downtown Chicago.</p>

			<p id="second_p">I am also about to dip my feet into astrophotography as I am always fascinated and always thinking on what is out there. Are we or are we not alone? Pretty sure we are not but, that is up to you on what to decide.</p>

			<p id="third_p"></p>By learning web design through General Assembly (insert thumbs-up emoticon here), I hope I can create a stunning website and keep you captivated and wanting for more. Take care and enjoy!</p>
